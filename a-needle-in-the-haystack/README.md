## Description

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an `array` full of junk but containing one `"needle"`

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

`"found the needle at position "` plus the `index` it found the needle, so: 

**Example(Input --> Output)**
```
["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
```

**Note: In COBOL, it should return** `"found the needle at position 6"`
